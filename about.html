				<h1>Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There's a *New* Mexico?</h1>
				<p>Slow down, Bart! My legs don't know how to be as long as yours. A lifetime of working with nuclear power has left me with a healthy green glow…and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner.</p>
				<p>"Thank the Lord"? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. <strong> God has no place within these walls, just like facts don't have a place within an organized religion.</strong> <em> Stan Lee never left.</em> I'm afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition.</p>
				<h2>Bart, with $10,000 we'd be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like…love!</h2>
				<p>I'll keep it short and sweet — Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business. I'll be back. You can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever, and when they get in, I'm back on the streets, with all my criminal buddies.</p>
			
							
				<p>I'll keep it short and sweet — Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business. Get ready, skanks! It's time for the truth train! Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There's a *New* Mexico?</p>
				<p>I'll be back. You can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever, and when they get in, I'm back on the streets, with all my criminal buddies. And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold.</p>
				<p>No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it. Mrs. Krabappel and Principal Skinner were in the closet making babies and I saw one of the babies and then the baby looked at me.</p>
				<p>I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming. Fire can be our friend; whether it's toasting marshmallows or raining down on Charlie. How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze.</p>
				<p>Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true! No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it. Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There's a *New* Mexico?</p>
